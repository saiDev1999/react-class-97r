// Forms: to collect the user information 

// forms ----> 
// input , textarea ,select 

// input ---> type="text","password","file","radio"


// Generally we have 2 types of components while dealing with forms 

// 1. Uncontrolled components 
// 1.In Uncontrolled components , state will not be controlled by react , but will be in dom control 
// 2. field validations were not possible 
// form validation will be possible 


// 2. Controlled components 

// 1. Controlled components will comes in react while working with forms 
// 2. In controlled components , state control will be in react hands 
// 3. field validations and form validations were possible 


// UseRef : useRef is a hook which can creates the reference to the dom , and persists the values between the renders 
// dom reference : focus of the input 

// useRef has a current property , we can focus the input or we can persists the values between renders 

// useRef will not create any re-render to the component , so fields validations were restricted
